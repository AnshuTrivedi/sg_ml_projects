# week 2 [27/07/20 - 02/08/20]
### Week 2  plan
* Please decide in your team a representative or team leader  who have to update here about team progress,organizing  team meetups. I request to post everything  related to projects work here instead of DMs .
* This week we will have meetup where we will discuss about roadblocks and project progress.
* We can organize session for beginners . Looking for speakers and session topics from beginners.
* Start project work and if feel any problem let us know .
### Project : Windmill Turbines Fault Detection updates.
* @Yash Kulkarni and @Shudipto Trafder guiding and leading project team.
* @Shudipto Trafder shared resoures helpful for project work 
   * Image classification https://www.kaggle.com/iamsdt/image-classification-cats-and-dogs-basic-to-end/
   * Tensorflow comes with two versions. TF1 and TF2. In 2020 you should start with TF2.Here is an introductory video from TF world 19.
     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ECD8J3dvDQ
   * Udacity also offered a Free course on TF2.
     https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-tensorflow-for-deep-learning--ud187
     This course covered ->
     1. Basic ML
     2. CNN
     3. RNN
     4. Time series
     5. TF Lite model (TF lite model is the light version of your main TF model)
   * Coursera: Tensorflow Specialization offered by deeplearning.ai
     https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice
     It's a collection of 4 Courses
     1. Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
     2. Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow
     3. Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
     4. Sequences, Time Series and Prediction
   * And Last on from youtube. Freecodecamp, they are non-profit organization. You can check this course. it 7 hours long. It covers
     all the topics covered from udacity and extra one Reinforcement Learning.
     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPYj3fFJGjk&t=91s
     
* 1st Project meetup keypoints
1. We have planned to cover all the basic concepts related to image data and start with smaller tasks like building a classifier. We are planning to train our model manually by    using Google Colaboratory and not using the platforms like Microsoft Azure or AWS. 
2. Majority of the team members want to have hands-on experience by building a model by actual coding the Neural Network layers in python. Most of the guys including me are new    to the image data and we have to still look for more relevant datasets if possible.  Maybe it will take little longer for us to complete the decided task and all of us are      totally happy with it :slightly_smiling_face:
3. Although few team members were not able to connect to the conference meeting, we have recorded our meeting so that everyone could go through a meeting discussion. Cheers !!      to everyone in the team @gul jain @Grace.D @Sabyh @Aarthi Alagammai @LauraT @Yash Bhawsar. :star-struck:
4. A special mention to one of our team member @Shudipto Trafder who guided us with the approach of how to handle image data as he has got experience working with deep learning projects. Thanks to him for letting us all with the important links.:thank_you:

  
   
### Project :  Emergency vs Non-Emergency Vehicle Classification
* Polled for weekly project meetup and decided Saturday for meeting

### Project:   Movie Recommendations
*  @Sreenithi Sridharan organised poll for weekly project meeting but couldn't decide due to voting proportion
*  @Sreenithi Sridharan organised another poll to decide project meetup day 
*  First meetup organised  </br>
   Topic: Movie Recommendations Project - First Step Discussions </br>
   Time: Jul 31, 2020, 10AM PDT | 5PM GMT | 10.30PM IST </br>
* 1st Project meeting keypoints 
   1. :point_right: First, we discussed what a Movie Recommendation system is. It can either be a simple score based sorting of top-rated movies or personalised movie                  recommendations based on characteristics like Movie Genre, Director, Actor, Rating, etc.
       In our case, we will be working on a personalised Movie Recommendation System.
   2. :point_right: So as with any ML project, our first step will be to find the right dataset for this project. Some known datasets are MovieLens, IMDb, and TMDb. So the first        task we decided is that we will research these 3 datasets and the features they have and come up with observations that we can discuss upon in the next meeting.  Based on        the discussions, we will decide on which dataset to use for this project.
   3. :point_right: And in the next meeting along with choosing the dataset, we'll discuss and split up the work for data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
   4. :point_right: Once the dataset is ready, we can have different team members try different ML models and compare the results.
       So for discussing about the dataset, we'll have another quick meeting day after tomorrow. Will setup a time poll for it soon!
 * @Sreenithi Sridharan  organised poll for quick meetupto to finalise the dataset.

### Project:Big Mart Sales Prediction
* Members started thread for project collaboration
* Members are looking for project leader 

### Project:  iMaterialist (Fashion) 2019 at FGVC6 Fine-grained segmentation task for fashion and apparel
* @Anshu Trivedi @Balkrushn Hirani discussed about project but couldn't make much progress.

### New members joining projects 
* @Shubhra Sachdev requested to join Movie Recommendation project
* @Akinwale Oshodi  willing to join project work but didn't join yet.
